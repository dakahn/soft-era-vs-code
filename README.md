## Contributing

### TODO:
- [ ] full pass on logic behind the coloring of various elements
- [ ] full pass on scoped definitions â€” probably start working over the code from a theme like [Dracula](https://github.com/dracula/visual-studio-code) that applies of a lot of nice variations to type (italics etc) at various scopes.
- [ ] apply theme colors to the integrated terminal
